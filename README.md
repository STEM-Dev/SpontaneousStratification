SpontaneousStratification
=========================

NetLogo Model of Spontaneous Stratification, a natural process in granular mixtures and an example of emergent pattern formation. This phenomena can be seen with a simple experiment by pouring a mixture of sand and large-grain colored sugar between two sheets of glass or plastic (a Hele-Shaw cell). This model is inspired by a video essay by George W. Hart for the Simons Foundation.
