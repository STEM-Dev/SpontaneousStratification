## HOW IT WORKS

The white particles are smaller and flow better than the larger red particles. The smaller particles can get trapped by the larger particles while the larger particles flow better in the presence of the smaller particles.

## HOW TO USE IT

Adjust the ratio of red particles from zero to one-hundred percent. Press "setup" and then "go". The auto-move? switch will allow the source to automatically move to the right.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Notice the striations (linear patterns) that form automatically.
