## HOW IT WORKS

The white particles are smaller and flow better than the larger red particles. The smaller particles can get trapped by the larger particles while the larger particles flow better in the presence of the smaller particles.

## HOW TO USE IT

Adjust the ratio of red particles from zero to one-hundred percent. Press "setup" and then "go". The auto-move? switch will allow the source to automatically move to the right.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Notice the striations (linear patterns) that form automatically.

## THINGS TO TRY

With auto-move? set to false, set the percent-red slider to zero (all sand-like particles) and run. What is the Max-X? In other words, how wide is the base? Now, set the percent-red slider to 100 (all sugar-like particles) and run. What is the new base width? What does this say about the two materials?

Now, set the percent-red to 20 (equal volumes because the red particles are four times larger than the white particles). Now run. Do you notice segregation? Why is this happening?

Note that the auto-run? switch allows the top feed to move to the right.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Add a switch to toggle between spontaneous stratification and spontaneous separation. Hint: consider pure 2D vs. "quasi-2D"

## NETLOGO FEATURES

Patch-sets are used to organizing the patches that each turtle tries to occupy, moves from, and moves to. This is especially useful for turtles that need to "occupy" more than one patch. (In NetLogo, a turtle automatically occupies one and only one patch).
